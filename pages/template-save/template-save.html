            <span class="bold">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parties.</span> This Agreement is made and entered into on March 17, 2019, between
            Alice (“Contractor”) and Bob (“Client”).
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Project.</span> Client is retaining Contractor to do the following work (the “Project”):
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span class="bold">a. Milestone 1</span> [provide an initial functioning kitten website with e-pet integration (as more fully described
            in the attached details addendum)]
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span class="bold">b. Milestone 2</span> [provide up to 6 hours of consultation and review work and provide a revised kitten website]
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            <span class="bold">c. Milestone 3</span> [provide up to 3 hours of consultation and review work and provide a final kitten website]
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment.</span> Client agrees to pay Contractor a total of $1,200 for the Project in
            installments based upon the completion of project milestones: Milestone 1: $600; Milestone 2: $300; and Milestone
            3: $300.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment Procedures.</span> Contractor may, from time to time, provide notice to Client
            indicating that work described for a specific milestone has been completed and that the payment for such milestone
            is due (each, a “Completion Notice”). Upon delivery of a Completion Notice, Client shall have 3 business days
            to reply to Contractor stating either (A) that Client certifies that the milestone has been completed and that
            payment for the milestone is due and payable (in which case such reply shall be accompanied by payment) or (B)
            that Client, reasonably and in good faith, contests that the milestone has been completed (in which case such
            reply shall be accompanied by a written description of the facts supporting Client’s contestation). If Client’s
            reply indicates that Client contests that the milestone has been completed, then Contractor will have 3 business
            days from delivery of the reply to either (A) resubmit the Completion Notice, (B) agree to reperform the work
            described in the specific milestone, (C) elect to have Section 5 (Dispute Resolution) apply to resolve the specific
            milestone or (D) elect seek termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 6 (Termination). If Client does
            not reply to a Completion Notice within 3 business days of delivery, Client will be deemed to have agreed that
            the milestone has been completed and payment for the milestone is due and payable. If Client does not make payment
            for a milestone that is either certified or deemed completed within 30 business days of such event, then Contractor
            may either (A) elect to have Section 5 (Dispute Resolution) apply to resolve the specific milestone or (B) elect
            seek termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 6 (Termination).
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispute Resolution.</span> If, pursuant to Section 4, Contractor elects to have dispute
            resolution apply to a dispute concerning a specific milestone, then Contractor and Client hereby covenant and
            agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the dispute and to adhere to and comply with the requirements of each
            the following dispute resolution mechanisms selected by Contractor in its sole discretion:
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. A period of 3 business days of good faith discussions via
            email.
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Online arbitration using one of the following alternative
            dispute resolution platforms:
            <span class="bold">kleros.io; augur.net.</span>
            <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Short-form mediation and/or arbitration pursuant to the JAMS
            rules.
            <br> If the dispute concerning a specific milestone is not resolved through the above methods selected by the Contractor,
            then Contractor may seek termination of the Agreement pursuant to Section 6 (Termination).
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="bold">6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination.</span> If, pursuant to Section 4 or Section 5, Contractor elects to terminate
            this Agreement due to Client’s contestation of a Completion Notice, then Contractor shall deliver a notice of
            termination to Client indicating the Agreement is terminated and the amount of any payments that remain due to
            Contractor (in which case such payment obligations of the Client will survive termination of this Agreement).
            If Contractor terminates the agreement pursuant to this Section 6, Contractor may seek enforcement of Client’s
            payment obligations, including by retaining legal counsel and seeking appropriate legal or equitable remedies
            in a court of law with competent jurisdiction including awards for special, consequential and punitive damages
            and attorneys’ fees as applicable. Contractor also may freely assign Client payment obligations to a third party
            debt collection service.
